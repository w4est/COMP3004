# Iteration v0.001 6:09pm Oct 22nd
~~ FYI username_list.txt is required to be in the debug directory (where the executable is) for the current iteration of 'Login' to work [change from empty to VALID if username is in the list, otherwise WRONG]

-- also changed the line edit to have placeholder text (light grey) as opposed to set text
