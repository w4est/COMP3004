# Iteration v0.002 12:32am Oct 23rd
-- Can now drag a window around and upon "changing" windows (destroying and creating) the child/new window will be in about 
   the same location as the original

-- layouts for the Login and the Register windows changed, now they flow with the resize (and don't look like garbage after)

# Iteration v0.001  6:09pm Oct 22nd
~~ FYI username_list.txt is required to be in the debug directory (where the executable is) for the current iteration of 'Login' to work [change from empty to VALID if username is in the list, otherwise WRONG]

-- also changed the line edit to have placeholder text (light grey) as opposed to set text
